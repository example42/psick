DESCRIPTION:
This module installs and manages openntpd.
Standard and extended classes are available.

USER VARIABLES:
In order to customize the behaviour of the module you can set the following variables:
$ntp_server  (default: [ "0.pool.ntp.org" , "1.pool.ntp.org" ] ) - Defines the ntp servers to use
$ntp_startup (default: "no" ) - Set the time immediately at startup if the local clock is off by more than 180 seconds (option -s).


USAGE:
# Standard Classes 
include openntpd              # Install and run openntpd daemon 
include openntpd::disable     # Disable openntpd service.
include openntpd::disableboot # Disable openntpd service at boot time, but don't stop if it's running.
include openntpd::absent      # Remove openntpd package.

# Extended Classes (require storeconfings)
include openntpd::monitor     # Monitor openntpd  Automatically included if $monitor=yes
include openntpd::backup      # Backup openntpd data - Automatically included if $backup=yes
include openntpd::firewall    # Manages firewall rule for openntpd service - Automatically included if $firewall=yes

# Extra Classes

# Generic main configuration infile modification Define
openntpd::conf { "ParameterName": value="YourValue"} 

# Extra Defines


DEPENDENCIES:
Standard classes generally don't need external modules.
Extended classes need the relevant external modules (import monitor ; import backup ... ) and the "common" module (import common)
openntpd::conf generic infile configuration define needs the "common" module
Check on individual Extra classes and defines if there are specific requirements (generally only the common module).
