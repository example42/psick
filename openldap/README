Puppet module: openldap

# Written by Lab42 #

Licence: Apache2

DESCRIPTION:
This module installs and manages openldap.
It's based on Example42's module structure and features standard and
extended classes for automatic monitoring, backup and firewalling.

All the variables used in this module are defined in the openldap::params class
(File: $MODULEPATH/openldap/manifests/params.pp). Here you can:
- Set default settings and filtering module's specific Users variables
- Add selectors for internal variables to adapt the module to different OSes
- Review and eventually change default settings for variables that affect the
  Example42 extended classes.

Customizations for different projects and logic on how to populate configuration
files should be placed in the $my_project classes.

Note that just by including the openldap class the slapd.conf is modified, according
to the variables provided (in other Example42 modules the main config file is not 
modified by default).
Note also that this modules uses (and enforces on distros like Ubuntu10.04) the usage
of the "old" slapd.conf instead of the newer ldap based configuration (cn=config) 
available since OpenLdap > 2.3.
Up to now (v. 2.4.23) slapd.conf is still supported by OpenLdap.


MODULE'S SPECIFIC USER VARIABLES:
$openldap_base_dn # The Base dn to use for your OpenLdap database (not that the default
                  # configuration file provided with this module implies the usage of a single
                  # database. Default: "dc=example42,dc=com"
$openldap_root_dn # The OpenLdap root_dn. Default: "cn=Manager,${base_dn}"
$openldap_rootpw  # The root_dn password, in slapd.conf format.
                  # Default: "{SSHA}6cOchl1ZhL+N/iuN+MoZ6vFyLcCtw2Ug" (example42)
$openldap_use_ssl # Set to "yes" if you want to activate SSL support. Default: "no"
$openldap_support_solaris_clients # Set to "yes" if you want to add the schemas needed for
                                  # authentication of Solaris client. Default: "no"
$openldap_support_samba # Set to "yes" if you want to add the schemas needed when using
                        # (open)ldap as users backend in Samba. Default: "no"
$openldap_multimaster # Set to "yes" if you want to enable N Way Multimaster mode
                      # Note that for each server you must define at least one entry 
                      # in $openldap_multimaster_masters
$openldap_multimaster_masters # One or more servers (defined in an array) to be considered 
                              # masters (providers) for the current server.
                              # If you want a 2 server multimaster layout just specify here
                              # the name of the "other" server. If you want a multimaster mesh
                              # with N servers, specify here an array containing all the "other"
                              # servers.
$openldap_extra      # Include extra scripts to manage ldap users (Default: "yes")
$openldap_extra_user # The user that can run the ldap users management scripts (Default: "root")
$openldap_extra_dir  # The directory where the exta ldap scripts are placed (Default: "/root/ldap")


USAGE:
# Standard Classes 
include openldap              # Install and run openldap 

include openldap::disable     # Disable openldap service.
include openldap::disableboot # Disable openldap service at boot time, but don't stop if is running.
include openldap::absent      # Remove openldap package.
include openldap::debug       # Used for debugging purposes (not resource hungry)
                              # Automatically included if $debug=yes
                              # Requires Example42's puppet::params and puppet::debug

# Extended Classes (generally require storeconfigs)
include openldap::monitor     # Monitor openldap
                              # Automatically included if $monitor=yes
                              # Requires Example42's monitor module
include openldap::backup      # Backup openldap data
                              # Automatically included if $backup=yes
                              # Requires Example42's backup module
include openldap::firewall    # Manages firewall rules for openldap service
                              # Automatically included if $firewall=yes
                              # Requires Example42's firewall module

# Generic define to set parameters in the main configuration file. EXPERIMENTAL.

EXAMPLE42 GENERAL VARIABLES:
Example42 modules collection uses some general variables that can influence the
behaviour of this module. You can happily live without considering or setting them,
but they can be useful to get many useful features out of the box.
$my_project - If set, permits you to alter and customize the module behaviour
  and files's deploy logic in custom project classes than can be placed in a separated module.   
$base_source - Lets you define an alternative source for static files:
  - $base_source not set -> Files are looked in puppet://$servername/ (the PuppetMaster)
  - $base_source set -> Files are in $base_source ( Ex: puppet://$servername/$my_module ) 
  Note that the module automatically manages the different paths for Puppet pre 0.25
$debug - If set to yes writes in /var/lib/puppet/debug/ useful debugging info

VARIABLES FOR EXTENDED MODULES:
$monitor - Set to "yes" to enable auto monitoring classes 
$monitor_tool - Defines the monitor tools to activate (At leat one, can be an array)
Check openldap/manifests/monitor.pp for more info on openldap monitoring related variables.

$backup - Set to "yes" to enable auto backuping classes 
$backup_tool - Defines the backup tools to activate (At leat one, can be an array)
Check openldap/manifests/backup.pp for more info on openldap backuping related variables.


DEPENDENCIES:
Standard classes generally don't need external modules.
Extended classes need the relevant external modules and the Example42 "common" module.
openldap::conf generic infile configuration define needs the Example42 "common" module
