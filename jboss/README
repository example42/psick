Licence: Apache2 

DESCRIPTION:
This module installs and manages jboss either via system packages or native sources.
It provides a define to manage multiple instances on the same host.

Even if is intended to adapt to different Jboss versions and installation types, it has been 
tested only with Jboss 6 (Community Edition zip file) on Ubuntu.

All the variables used in this module are defined in the jboss::params class
(File: $MODULEPATH/jboss/manifests/params.pp). Here you can:
- Set default settings and filtering module's specific Users variables
- Add selectors for internal variables to adapt the module to different OSes
- Review and eventually change default settings for variables that affect the
  Example42 extended classes.

Customizations for different projects and logic on how to populate configuration
files should be placed in the $my_project classes.


MODULE'S SPECIFIC USER VARIABLES:

USAGE:
include jboss                # Installs jboss (no instance provided by default, unless the package does it)
jboss::instance { "myapp": } # Creates "myapp" instance (Check documentation on jboss/manifests/instance.pp 
                             # for customization options)

If you want multiple instances you can bind them to different IP address :
include jboss
jboss::instance { "myapp1": bindaddr => 10.42.42.180 }
jboss::instance { "myapp2": bindaddr => 10.42.42.181 }
If you want to use the same address for multiple instances you've to manage in a custom way the offset on
the various ports that Jboss opens by default.

You can set this variables to alter jboss installation:
$jboss_use_package - Define if you want to install Jboss via a package or from original source zip files. 
                     Default "no": files are downloaded from the Internet (or source defined in $jboss_source_url )
$jboss_source_url  - Define an alternative source from where to download the source zip files.
                     Default are the official Jboss community download urls
$jboss_version     - Define the Jboss version to install. Default is 6.                       
$jboss_destination_dir - Define where to unzip the source file. Default /usr/local
$jboss_jboss_dir       - Define the base jboss dir (a link with this name is created pointing to the extracted dir)
                         Default: $jboss_destination_dir/jboss
$jboss_download_dir    - Define where to download the source zip file. Default /var/tmp

# Extended Classes
If you use Example42 monitoring abstraction or Puppi, jboss::instance creates the relevant configurations


EXAMPLE42 GENERAL VARIABLES:
Example42 modules collection uses some general variables that can influence the
behaviour of this module. You can happily live without considering or setting them,
but they can be useful to get many useful features out of the box.
$my_project - If set, permits you to alter and customize the module behaviour
  and files's deploy logic in custom project classes
  The custom class jboss::$my_module autoloads from MODULEPATH/jboss/manifests/$my_project.pp
  but you can place it in a separated module by explicitely importing it:
  "import $my_project" to have something like MODULEPATH/$my_project/manifests/jboss.pp
$base_source - Lets you define an alternative source for static files:
  - $base_source not set -> Files are looked in puppet://$servername/ (the PuppetMaster)
  - $base_source set -> Files are in $base_source ( Ex: puppet://$servername/$my_module ) 
  Note that the module automatically manages the different paths for Puppet pre 0.25
$debug - If set to yes writes in /var/lib/puppet/debug/ useful debugging info

VARIABLES FOR EXTENDED MODULES:
$puppi - Set to "yes" to enable jboss plugins for puppi
Check jboss/manifests/puppi.pp for more info.

$monitor - Set to "yes" to enable auto monitoring classes 
$monitor_tool - Defines the monitor tools to activate (At leat one, can be an array)
Check jboss/manifests/monitor.pp for more info on jboss monitoring related variables.

$firewall - Set to "yes" to enable auto firewalling classes
$firewall_tool - Defines the firewall tools to activate
Check jboss/manifests/firewall.pp for more info on jboss firewalling related variables.


DEPENDENCIES:
Standard classes generally don't need external modules.
Extended classes need the relevant external modules.
jboss::instance needs curl and unzip commands. They are provided in the jboss::prerequisites class.
