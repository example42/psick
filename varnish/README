Puppet module: varnish

# Written by Marco Bonetti #

Licence: Apache2

DESCRIPTION:
This module installs and manages varnish.
Standard and Example42 extended classes are available.
Generally you can easily import and use standard classes in your own modules set, without other Example42 modules.
You can place your customizations in the dedicated "project" files (by default example42.pp, use the example42_project_rename.sh script to rename them).
Decide and customize how you want to define configuration files: static files, templates, infile modifications...


USER VARIABLES:
varnish_port (default 80) - Port to listen to for incoming connections
varnish_nfiles (default 131072) - Maximum number of open files (for ulimit -n)
varnish_memlock (default 82000) - Maximum locked memory size (for ulimit -l)
varnish_backendhost (default: 127.0.0.1) - Backend host to cache
varnish_backendport (default: 8080) - Backend port to cache

USAGE:
# Standard Classes 
include varnish              # Install and run varnish 

include varnish::disable     # Disable varnish service.
include varnish::disableboot # Disable varnish service at boot time, but don't stop if it's running.
include varnish::absent      # Remove varnish package.
include varnish::debug       # Used for debugging purposes (not resource hungry) - Automatically included if $debug=yes - Requires Example42's puppet module

# Extended Classes (generally require storeconfigs)
include varnish::monitor     # Monitor varnish - Automatically included if $monitor=yes - Requires Example42's monitor module
include varnish::backup      # Backup varnish data - Automatically included if $backup=yes - Requires Example42's backup module
include varnish::firewall    # Manages firewall rule for varnish service - Automatically included if $firewall=yes - Requires Example42's firewall module

# Generic define to set parameters in the main configuration file. EXPERIMENTAL.
varnish::conf { "ParameterName": value="YourValue"} # Generic 

# Module specific classes

# Module specific defines


GENERAL VARIABLES:
Example42 modules collection uses some general variables that can influence the behaviour of this module.
You can happily live without considering or setting them, but they can be useful to manage different projects maintanining the module's resuability. 
$my_project - If set, permits you to alter and customize the module behaviour
  and files's deploy logic in custom project classes than can be placed in a separated module.   
$base_source - Let you define an alternative source for static files:
  - $base_source not set -> Files are looked in puppet://$servername/ (the PuppetMaster)
  - $base_source set -> Files are looked in $base_source ( could be puppet://$servername/$my_module ) 
  Note that the module automatically manages the different paths for Puppet pre 0.25
  

DEPENDENCIES:
Standard classes generally don't need external modules.
Extended classes need the relevant external modules ( monitor ; backup ... ) and the "common" module.
varnish::conf generic infile configuration define needs the "common" module
Check on individual module specific classes and defines if there are specific requirements.
