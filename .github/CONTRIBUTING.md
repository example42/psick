## Really want to contribute to PSICK?!?

### Supply your own profile

One of the main components of PSICK is the collection of profiles, and the framework to easily switch from one to another.

We encourage the existence of multiple profiles to manage applications ussing different patterns and modules, we think it would be nice to have a good library of profiles to choose from and customise when needed.

So if you have written a good profile, which may adapt to common use cases, both for new or existing applications, you're welcomed to share it:

  * the profile class 
  * some hiera examples
  * enventual modules to add to Puppetfile
  * possibly spec test for the profile

### Submit your bug or feature request

We are not suprised. There are so many combinations of OS, applications and use cases, that it's hard to test them all.

We still welcome bug fix or feature requests, even better relevant PR, we want to make PSICK as good and useful as possible,
