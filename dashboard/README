In order to customize the behaviour of the module you can set the following variables:

$dashboard_db  (default: sqlite) - Define DB backend ("sqlite", "postgresql" or "mysql")
$dashboard_db_server  (default: localhost) - Define DB server host (used if $dashboard_db = "mysql" or "postgresql")
$dashboard_db_user  (default: root) - Define DB access user (used if $dashboard_db = "mysql" or "postgresql")
$dashboard_db_password  (default: undefined) - Define DB access password (used if $dashboard_db = "mysql" or "postgresql")

Extended classes need the relevant external modules (import monitor ; import backup ... ) and the "common" module (import common)
