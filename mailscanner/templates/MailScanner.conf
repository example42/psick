# Main configuration file for the MailScanner E-Mail Virus Scanner
#
# It's good practice to check through configuration files to make sure
# they fit with your system and your needs, whatever you expect them to
# contain.
#
# Note: If your directories are symlinked (soft-linked) in any way,
#       please put their *real* location in here, not a path that
#       includes any links. You may get some very strange error
#       messages from some of the virus scanners if you don't.
#
# Note for Version 4.00 and above:
#       A lot of the settings can take a ruleset as well as just simple
#       values. These rulesets are files containing rules which are applied
#       to the current message to calculate the value of the configuration
#       option. The rules are checked in the order they appear in the ruleset.
#
# Note for Version 4.03 and above:
#       As well as rulesets, you can now include your own functions in
#       here. Look at the directory containing Config.pm and you will find
#       CustomConfig.pm. In here, you can add your own "value" function and
#       an Initvalue function to set up any global state you need such as
#       database connections. Then for a setting below, you can put:
#               Configuration Option = &ValueFunction
#       where "ValueFunction" is the name of the function you have
#       written in CustomConfig.pm.
#
# Note for Version 4.54 and above:
#       Numbers can be scaled by 1 thousand, 1 million or 1 billion by
#       putting a "k", "m" or "g" immediately after the number. You must
#       *not* put any spaces between the number and the k, m or g.
#
# Note for Version 4.77 and above:
#	If you are going to use "host:" in rulesets, it is imperative that
#	you have a local caching name-server (DNS server). Or else using
#	"host:" in rulesets will really slow you down.
#
# Note for Version 4.78 and above:
#       This file now supports nested "include" statements. The syntax is
#       include filename-wildcard-here
#       where filename-wildcard-here is replaced with the full path of one
#       or more other MailScanner.conf files to be read. You can use the
#       normal shell wildcard characters such as "*".
#       For each setting, the last value read will be used by MailScanner.
#       At the end of this file, there is an "include" that will pull in
#       all the files in /etc/MailScanner/conf.d so you can just add
#       your own local changes in there, and not need to modify this file.
#

#
# Definition of variables which are substituted into definitions below.
#
# You can add any %variables% that you want to use in addition to the
# ones provided.
#
# You can also use any shell environment variables here such as $HOSTNAME
# or ${HOSTNAME} in configuration settings and rulesets. See the
# definition of "Hostname" for an example.
#

# Enter a short identifying name for your organisation below, this is
# used to make the X-MailScanner headers unique for your organisation.
# Multiple servers within one site should use an identical value here
# to avoid adding multiple redundant headers where mail has passed
# through several servers within your organisation.
#
# Note: Some Symantec scanners complain (incorrectly) about "."
# ***** characters appearing in the names of headers.
#       Some other mail servers complain about "_" characters
#       appearing in the names of headers as well.
#       So don't put "." or "_" in this setting.

# Incoming Work Dir Settings
# --------------------------

# external archive unpackers instead of ClamAV's built-in ones.

# If you want to create the temporary working files so they are owned

# you can change that here.
#
# Note: If the "Run As User" is not "root" you cannot change the

# Note: If the "Run As User" is "root" (or not set at all) and you are
#       using the "clamd" virus scanner AND clamd is not running as root,
#       then this must be set to the group clamd is using (from your

# Use with care, you may well open security holes.
#
# Note: If the "Run As User" is "root" (or not set at all) and you are

# Processing Incoming Mail

Max Unscanned Messages Per Scan = 30
Max Unsafe Messages Per Scan = 30

# If more messages are found in the queue than this, then switch to an
# "accelerated" mode of processing messages. This will cause it to stop
# scanning messages in strict date order, but in the order it finds them
# in the queue. If your queue is bigger than this size a lot of the time,
# then some messages could be greatly delayed. So treat this option as
# "in emergency only".
Max Normal Queue Size = 800

# If this is set to yes, then email messages passing through MailScanner
# will be processed and checked, and all the other options in this file
# will be used to control what checks are made on the message.
# If this is set to no, then email messages will NOT be processed or
# checked *at all*, and so any viruses or other problems will be ignored.
#
# The purpose of this option is to set it to be a ruleset, so that you
# can skip all scanning of mail destined for some of your users/customers
# and still scan all the rest.
# A sample ruleset would look like this:
#   To:       bad.customer.com  no
#   From:     ignore.domain.com no
#   FromOrTo: default           yes
# That will scan all mail except mail to bad.customer.com and mail from
# ignore.domain.com. To set this up, put the 3 lines above into a file
# called /etc/MailScanner/rules/scan.messages.rules and set the next line to
# Scan Messages = %rules-dir%/scan.messages.rules
# This can also be the filename of a ruleset (as illustrated above).
Scan Messages = yes

# You may not want to receive mail from certain addresses and/or to certain
# addresses. If so, you can do this with your email transport (sendmail,
# Postfix, etc) but that will just send a one-line message which is not
# helpful to the user sending the message.
# If this is set to yes, then the message set by the "Rejection Report"
# will be sent instead, and the incoming message will be deleted.
# If you want to store a copy of the original incoming message then use the
# "Archive Mail" setting to archive a copy of it.
# The purpose of this option is to set it to be a ruleset, so that you
# can reject messages from a few offending addresses where you need to  send
# a polite reply instead of just a brief 1-line rejection message.
Reject Message = no

# Limit the number of attempts made at processing any particular message.

Still Deliver Silent Viruses = no

# Strings listed here will be searched for in the output of the virus scanners.
# It works to achieve the opposite effect of the "Silent Viruses" listed above.

Allow Password-Protected Archives = no

# Normally, you can still get the filenames out of a password-protected

# There is no way to guarantee that the file fetched by the user's email
# package is free from viruses, as MailScanner never sees it.
# This feature is dangerous as it can allow viruses to be fetched from
# other Internet sites by a user's email package. The user would just
# think it was a normal email attachment and would have been scanned by
# MailScanner.
# It is only currently supported by Netscape 6 anyway, and the only people
# who use it are the IETF. So I would strongly advise leaving this switched off.
# This can also be the filename of a ruleset.
Allow External Message Bodies = no

# Do you want to check for "Phishing" attacks?
# These are attacks that look like a genuine email message from your bank,
# which contain a link to click on to take you to the web site where you
# will be asked to type in personal information such as your account number
# or credit card details.
# Except it is not the real bank's web site at all, it is a very good copy
# of it run by thieves who want to steal your personal information or
# credit card details.
# These can be spotted because the real address of the link in the message
# is not the same as the text that appears to be the link.
# Note: This does cause extra load, particularly on systems receiving lots
#       of spam such as secondary MX hosts.
# This can also be the filename of a ruleset.
Find Phishing Fraud = yes

# While detecting "Phishing" attacks, do you also want to point out links
# to numeric IP addresses. Genuine links to totally numeric IP addresses

# IP address is found in a link, the same phishing warning message is used
# as in the Find Phishing Fraud option above.
# This can also be the filename of a ruleset.
Also Find Numeric Phishing = yes

# If this is set to yes, then most of the URL in a link must match the
# destination address it claims to take you to. This is the default as it is
# a much stronger test and is very hard to maliciously avoid.
# If this is set to no, then just the company name and country (and any
# names between the two, dependent on the specific country) must match.
# This is not as strict as it will not protect you against internal
# malicious sites based within the company being abused. For example, it would
# not find www.nasty.company-name.co.uk pretending to be
# www.nice.company-name.co.uk. But it will still detect most phishing attacks
# of the type www.nasty.co.jp versus www.nice.co.jp.

#
# Attachment Filename Checking
# ----------------------------
#

# There are now 2 sets of configurations for filename and filetype checking.
# One set applies to files found within attachments which are archives,
# their names start with "Archives:".
# The other set of configuration options applies to normal attachments,
# their names do *not* start with "Archives:".

# What sort of attachments are considered to be archives?
# You may well consider, for example, zip and rar files to be archives, but
# maybe TNEF files to not be archives as they are really just another way
# of supplying attachments that is only used by Microsoft Exchange and Outlook.
# This is a space-separated list of the types which are treated as archives.
# Valid keywords within this are:
#       zip  -- Zip files and Microsoft Office 2007 documents
#       rar  -- Rar archives
#       uu   -- UU-encoded files
#       ole  -- Microsoft ".doc" and ".xls" and ".ppt" files
#       tnef -- "winmail.dat" files created by Microsoft Exchange or Outlook
Archives Are = zip rar ole

# To simplify web-based configuration systems, there are now two extra
# settings here. They are both intended for use with normal rulesets
# that you would expect to find in %rules-dir%. The first gives a list
# of patterns to match against the attachment filenames, and a filename
# is allowed if it matches any of these patterns. The second gives the
# the equivalent list for patterns that are used to deny filenames.
# If either of these match at all, then filename.rules.conf is ignored
# for that filename.
# So you can easily have a set like this:
# Allow Filenames = \.txt$ \.pdf$
# Deny  Filenames = \.com$ \.exe$ \.cpl$ \.pif$
# which is a lot simpler than having to handle filename.rules.conf!
# It is far simpler when you want to change the allowed+denied list for
# different domains/addresses, as you can use the filename of a simple
# ruleset here instead.
# NOTE: The filename and filetype rules are separate, so if you want to
#       allow executable *.exe files you will need at least
#           Allow Filenames = \.exe$
#           Allow Filetypes = executable
#       to make it pass both tests. If either test denies the attachment
#       then it will be blocked.

# Allow any attachment filenames matching any of the patterns listed here.
# If this setting is empty, it is ignored and no matches are made.
# This can also be the filename of a ruleset.

# Do you want to add a watermark to each email message?
# Setting this enables delivery error messages to be identified as yours
# so you want to see them. Delivery error messages without valid watermarks
# are treated as spam (or whatever you set below), as you probably don't
# want to see them. Spammers can send vast quantities of spam claiming to
# come from you so that you get all the delivery errors (known as a "joe-job"
# attack).
# This can also be the filename of a ruleset.
Add Watermark = yes

# Do you want to check watermarks?
# This can also be the filename of a ruleset.
Check Watermarks With No Sender = yes

# If the message has an invalid watermark and no sender address, then it
# is a delivery error (DSN) for a message which didn't come from us.
# Delivery errors have no sender address.
# So we probably want to treat it as spam, or high-scoring spam.
# This option can take one of 5 values:

#         "spam",
#         "high-scoring spam",
#         "nothing" or
#         a number greater than 0.
# If it is set to "delete", then the message is deleted and no further action
# is taken.
# If it is set to a number, then that is added to the message's spam score
# and it's spam status is updated accordingly.
# If you set it to "nothing" then there probably isn't much
# point in checking watermarks at all. But it could still be useful in
# rulesets and Custom Functions.
# This can also be the filename of a ruleset.
Treat Invalid Watermarks With No Sender as Spam = nothing

# Enable this feature if you have more then one Mailscanner installation
# (or you have a trust relationship with another Mailscanner user). An
# example would be a secondary MX with MailScanner installed which relays
# to the primary MX for delivery. For this to work you need to use the
# same value for "Watermark Header", and have the same "Watermark Secret".
#
# This could be achieved by using a ruleset.
#
# This feature skips Spam Checks if the Watermark is trusted. The trust
# only works between servers so will not apply to replies to emails.
#
# If the Watermark has expired or is invalid then the message is processed
# as normal.
# This can also be the filename of a ruleset.
Check Watermarks To Skip Spam Checks = yes

# This is the secret key used in the watermark calculations to ensure

# Thi can also be the filename of a ruleset.
Watermark Secret = %org-name%-Secret

# This sets the lifetime of a watermark. Set it to the maximum length of
# time that you want to allow for delivery errors to be delivered.

# a reasonable value to use.
# This time is measured in seconds. 7 days = 604800 seconds.
# This can also be the filename of a ruleset.
Watermark Lifetime = 604800

# This sets the name of the Watermark header. Good to make sure this is

#
# SpamAssassin
# ------------
#

# Do you want to find spam using the "SpamAssassin" package?
# This can also be the filename of a ruleset.
Use SpamAssassin = yes

# SpamAssassin is not very fast when scanning huge messages, so messages
# bigger than this value will be truncated to this length for SpamAssassin
# testing. The original message will not be affected by this. This value
# is a good compromise as very few spam messages are bigger than this.
#
# Now for the options:
# 1) <length of data in bytes>
# 2) <length of data in bytes> trackback
# 3) <length of data in bytes> continue <max extra bytes allowed>
#
# 1) Put in a simple number.
#    This will be the simple cut-off point for messages that are larger than
#    this number.
# 2) Put in a number followed by 'trackback'.
#    Once the size limit is reached, MailScanner reverses towards the start
#    of the message, until it hits a line that is blank. The message passed
#    to SpamAssassin is truncated there. This stops any part-images being
#    passed to SpamAssassin, and so avoids rules which trigger on this.
# 3) Put in a number followed by 'continue' followed by another number.
#    Once the size limit is reached, MailScanner continues adding to the data
#    passed to SpamAssassin, until at most the 2nd number of bytes have been
#    added looking for a blank line. This tries to complete the image data
#    that has been started when the 1st number of bytes has been reached,
#    while imposing a limit on the amount that can be added (to avoid attacks).
#
# If all this confuses you, just leave it alone at "40k" as that is good.
Max SpamAssassin Size = 200k

# This replaces the SpamAssassin configuration value 'required_hits'.
# If a message achieves a SpamAssassin score higher than this value,
# it is spam. See also the High SpamAssassin Score configuration option.
# This can also be the filename of a ruleset, so the SpamAssassin
# required_hits value can be set to different values for different messages.
Required SpamAssassin Score = 6

# If a message achieves a SpamAssassin score higher than this value,
# then the "High Scoring Spam Actions" are used. You may want to use
# this to deliver moderate scores, while deleting very high scoring messsages.
# This can also be the filename of a ruleset.
High SpamAssassin Score = 10

# Set this option to "yes" to enable the automatic whitelisting functions
# available within SpamAssassin. This will cause addresses from which you
# get real mail, to be marked so that it will never incorrectly spam-tag
# messages from those addresses.
# To disable whitelisting, you must set "use_auto_whitelist 0" in your
# spam.assassin.prefs.conf file as well as set this to no.
SpamAssassin Auto Whitelist = yes

# If SpamAssassin takes longer than this (in seconds), the check is
# abandoned and the timeout noted.
SpamAssassin Timeout = 75

# If SpamAssassin times out more times in a row than this, then it will be
# marked as "unavailable" until MailScanner next re-starts itself.
# This means that remote network failures causing SpamAssassin trouble will
# not mean your mail stops flowing.
Max SpamAssassin Timeouts = 10

# The total number of SpamAssassin attempts during which "Max SpamAssassin
# Timeouts" will cause SpamAssassin to stop doing all network-based tests.
# If double the timeout value is reached (i.e. it continues to timeout at
# the same frequency as before) then it is marked as "unavailable".
# See the previous comment for more information.
# The default values of 10 and 20 mean that 10 timeouts in any sequence of
# 20 attempts will trigger the behaviour described above, until the next
# periodic restart (see "Restart Every").
SpamAssassin Timeouts History = 30

# If the message sender is on any of the Spam Lists, do you still want
# to do the SpamAssassin checks? Setting this to "no" will reduce the load
# on your server, but will stop the High Scoring Spam Actions from ever
# happening.
# This can also be the filename of a ruleset.
Check SpamAssassin If On Spam List = yes

# Normally, SpamAssassin skips over all non-text attachments and does not
# scan them for indications that the message is spam.
# This setting over-rides that behaviour, telling SpamAssassin to scan all
# attachments regardless of type. This can be very useful for spotting rude
# and derogatory content in Microsoft Word documents, for example.
# However, it does slightly slow SpamAssassin and so is disabled by default.
# Setting this to "yes" will have no effect without a small patch to the
# SpamAssassin code. You can fetch the patch for your version of SpamAssassin
# from "http://www.mailscanner.info/mcp.html#patches". That web page will
# explain in detail how to apply the patch.
# This can also be the filename of a ruleset.
Include Binary Attachments In SpamAssassin = no

# Do you want to include the "Spam Score" header. This shows 1 character
# (Spam Score Character) for every point of the SpamAssassin score. This
# makes it very easy for users to be able to filter their mail using
# whatever SpamAssassin threshold they want. For example, they just look
# for "sssss" for every message whose score is > 5, for example.
# This can also be the filename of a ruleset.
Spam Score = yes

# Many naive spammers send out the same message to lots of people.
# These messages are very likely to have roughly the same SpamAssassin score.
# For extra speed, cache the SpamAssassin results for the messages
# being processed so that you only call SpamAssassin once for all of the
# messages.
# If you set this to "no" then the entire SpamAssassin Cache Database File

# This can also be the filename of a ruleset.
Cache SpamAssassin Results = yes

# you automatically when MailScanner is started.
# Note: If you move the "Incoming Work Dir" then you should move this too.
SpamAssassin Cache Database File = /var/spool/MailScanner/incoming/SpamAssassin.cache.db

# If you are using the Bayesian statistics engine on a busy server,

# at regular intervals. This is measures in seconds.
# 1 day = 86400 seconds.
# To disable this feature set this to 0.
# Note: If you enable this feature, set "bayes_auto_expire 0" in

#
# What to do with spam
# --------------------
#

# This is a list of actions to take when a message is spam.
# It can be any combination of the following:
#    deliver                 - deliver the message as normal
#    delete                  - delete the message
#    store                   - store the message in the (spam) quarantine
#    store-nonmcp            - store the message in the non-MCP quarantine
#    store-mcp               - store the message in the MCP quarantine
#    store-nonspam           - store the message in the non-spam quarantine
#    store-spam              - store the message in the spam quarantine
#    store-<directory-path>  - store the message in the <directory-path>
#    bounce                  - send a rejection message back to the sender
#    forward user@domain.com - forward a copy of the message to user@domain.com
#                              See the note below about the keywords that
#                              can be used.
#    striphtml               - convert all in-line HTML content to plain text.
#                              You need to specify "deliver" as well for the
#                              message to reach the original recipient.
#    attachment              - Convert the original message into an attachment
#                              of the message. This means the user has to take
#                              an extra step to open the spam, and stops "web
#                              bugs" very effectively.
#    notify                  - Send the recipients a short notification that
#                              spam addressed to them was not delivered. They
#                              can then take action to request retrieval of
#                              the original message if they think it was not
#                              spam.
#    header "name: value"    - Add the header
#                                name: value
#                              to the message. name must not contain any spaces.
#                              The "value" may contain the magic keyword "_TO_"
#                              anywhere in it. _TO_ will be replaced by a

#                              of the message. This is very useful if you just
#                              forward the message to a new address and don't
#                              use the "deliver" action, as otherwise the list
#                              of the original recipients may be lost.

#                              .pm with the 'parameter' passed in. This can be
#                              used to implement any custom action you require.
#
# "forward" keywords
# ==================
# In an email address specified in the "forward" action, several keywords can
# be used which will be substituted with various properties of the message:
# _FROMUSER_   The left-hand side of the address of the sender.
# _FROMDOMAIN_ The right-hand side of the address of the sender.
# _TOUSER_     The left-hand side of each of the recipients in turn.
# _TODOMAIN_   The right-hand side of each of the recipients in turn.
# _DATE_       The date the message was received by MailScanner.
# This means that you can forward messages to email addresses which show the
# original recipients of the message, which could be very useful when
# delivering into spam archive management systems.
#
# The default value I have set here enables Thunderbird to automatically
# handle spam when set to trust the "SpamAssassin" headers.

Non Spam Actions = deliver header "X-Spam-Status: No"

# This next setting is very powerful. It allows you to adjust the list of
# actions taken on a message by adding or removing any action or actions,
# depending on what SpamAssassin rules it matched.
# It can be used to replace the functionality of MCP, but without the large
# processing overhead that involves.
#
# The setting consists of a comma-separated list of
# SA_RULENAME=>action,action,...
# pairs, where 'SA_RULENAME' is the name of any SpamAssassin rule (or
# meta-rule), and 'action' is the name of any of the actions listed above
# the 'Spam Actions' configuration setting or the word "not-" preceding any
# of the action names.
# Preceding the action name with "not-" as in "not-deliver" or "not-forward
# user@domain.com" will cause the action to be removed from the list of
# actions that would normally be taken on this message.
#
# All of the keywords available in the "forward" action also work here.
#
# You can specify a comma-separated list of actions if you need more than 1
# action per rule.
#
# Example: Setting this to
# SpamAssassin Rule Actions = FROM_BOSS_WIFE=>not-forward secretary@domain.com
# would result in mail from the boss's wife not being forwarded to the boss's
# secretary, which would be useful if the non-spam actions for the message
# included forwarding to the boss's secretary.
#
# You can also trigger actions on the spam score of the message. You can
# compare the spam score with a number and cause this to trigger an action.
# For example, instead of a SA_RULENAME you can specify
# SpamScore>number or SpamScore>=number or SpamScore==number or
# SpamScore<number or SpamScore<=number
# where "number" is the threshold value you are comparing it against.
# So you could have a rule/action pair that looks like
#                  SpamScore>25=>delete
# This would cause all messages with a total spam score of more than 25 to be
# deleted. You can use this to implement multiple levels of spam actions in
# addition to the normal spam actions and the high-scoring spam actions.
#
# Combining this with a ruleset makes it even more powerful, as different
# recipients and/or senders can have different sets of rules applied to them.
#
# This can also be the filename of a ruleset, in which case the filename
# must end in ".rule" or ".rules".

# your "Minimum Code Status" setting.
#

# When trying to work out the value of configuration parameters which are
# using a ruleset, this controls the behaviour when a rule is checking the
# "To:" addresses.
# If this option is set to "yes", then the following happens when checking
# the ruleset:
#   a) 1 recipient. Same behaviour as normal.
#   b) Several recipients, but all in the same domain (domain.com for example).
#      The rules are checked for one that matches the string "*@domain.com".
#   c) Several recipients, not all in the same domain.
#      The rules are checked for one that matches the string "*@*".
#
# If this option is set to "no", then some rules will use the result they
# get from the first matching rule for any of the recipients of a message,
# so the exact value cannot be predicted for messages with more than 1
# recipient.
#
# This value *cannot* be the filename of a ruleset.
Use Default Rules With Multiple Recipients = no

# When working out from IP address the message was sent from,
# no or 0  ==> use the SMTP client address, ie. the address of the system

# yes or 1 ==> use the first IP address contained in the first "Received:"
#              header at the top of the email message's headers.
# Any number > 1 ==> use the first IP address contained in the n-th
#                    "Received:" header starting from the top of the email
#                    message's headers.
# Users of BarricadeMX should note that this setting will always be forced
# to 2, so it will always give you IP address of the system connecting to
# BarricadeMX.
#
# This is very useful when you are injecting mail into a MailScanner server
# using "fetchmail" as otherwise all mail will appear to be coming from the
# the IP address of the system running "fetchmail", and not the address the
# mail actually came from.
# You need to use this together with the "invisible" option in "fetchmail",

# This can also be the filename of a ruleset. For example, you could use a
# ruleset here so that messages coming to you are immediately delivered,
# while messages going to any other site are just placed in the queue in
# case the remote delivery is very slow.

# Don't set this unless you *know* you need to.
# For sendmail, it defaults to "posix".
# For sendmail 8.12 and older, you will probably need to change it to flock,

# This is the syslog "socket type" that MailScanner uses. This should
# normally be left blank, and MailScanner will use the type appropriate
# for your operating system. The only people who may ever need to change
# this are some Solaris users who may want to set it to "native". Read
# "man Sys::Syslog" for more information. The default value depends on your
# operating system.

# Do you want to automatically do a syntax check of the configuration files
# when MailScanner is started up? It will still start up, regardless, but it
# will print plenty of errors and warnings if anything important is wrong in
# your setup, instead of just logging it to your system's mail logs. It does
# slightly slow down the startup of MailScanner, of course, but that is only
# done once and so it does not really matter.
# This makes it easier for novice users.
# This cannot be a ruleset, only a simple value.

# virus scanner support code without realising it.
# Levels used are:
# none          - there may not even be any code.
# unsupported   - code may be completely untested, a contributed dirty hack,
#                 anything, really.
# alpha         - code is pretty well untested. Don't assume it will work.
# beta          - code is tested a bit. It should work.
# supported     - code *should* be reliable.
#
# Don't even *think* about setting this to anything other than "beta" or
# "supported" on a system that receives real mail until you have tested it
# yourself and are happy that it is all working as you expect it to.
