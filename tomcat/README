Puppet module: tomcat

# Written by Lab42 #

Licence: Apache2

DESCRIPTION:
This module installs and manages tomcat.
It's based on Example42's module structure and features standard and
extended classes for automatic monitoring, backup and firewalling.

All the variables used in this module are defined in the tomcat::params class
(File: $MODULEPATH/tomcat/manifests/params.pp). Here you can:
- Set default settings and filtering module's specific Users variables
- Add selectors for internal variables to adapt the module to different OSes
- Review and eventually change default settings for variables that affect the
  Example42 extended classes.

Customizations for different projects and logic on how to populate configuration
files should be placed in the $my_project classes.


MODULE'S SPECIFIC USER VARIABLES:


USAGE:
# Standard Classes 
include tomcat              # Install and run tomcat 

include tomcat::disable     # Disable tomcat service.
include tomcat::disableboot # Disable tomcat service at boot time, but don't stop if is running.
include tomcat::absent      # Remove tomcat package.
include tomcat::debug       # Used for debugging purposes (not resource hungry)
                         # Automatically included if $debug=yes
                         # Requires Example42's puppet::params and puppet::debug

# Extended Classes (generally require storeconfigs)
include tomcat::monitor     # Monitor tomcat
                         # Automatically included if $monitor=yes
                         # Requires Example42's monitor module
include tomcat::backup      # Backup tomcat data
                         # Automatically included if $backup=yes
                         # Requires Example42's backup module
include tomcat::firewall    # Manages firewall rules for tomcat service
                         # Automatically included if $firewall=yes
                         # Requires Example42's firewall module

# Generic define to set parameters in the main configuration file. EXPERIMENTAL.
tomcat::conf { "ParameterName": value="YourValue"} # Generic 

# Module specific classes

# Module specific defines


EXAMPLE42 GENERAL VARIABLES:
Example42 modules collection uses some general variables that can influence the
behaviour of this module. You can happily live without considering or setting them,
but they can be useful to get many useful features out of the box.
$my_project - If set, permits you to alter and customize the module behaviour
  and files's deploy logic in custom project classes than can be placed in a separated module.   
$base_source - Lets you define an alternative source for static files:
  - $base_source not set -> Files are looked in puppet://$servername/ (the PuppetMaster)
  - $base_source set -> Files are in $base_source ( Ex: puppet://$servername/$my_module ) 
  Note that the module automatically manages the different paths for Puppet pre 0.25
$debug - If set to yes writes in /var/lib/puppet/debug/ useful debugging info

VARIABLES FOR EXTENDED MODULES:
$monitor - Set to "yes" to enable auto monitoring classes 
$monitor_tool - Defines the monitor tools to activate (At leat one, can be an array)
Check tomcat/manifests/monitor.pp for more info on tomcat monitoring related variables.

$backup - Set to "yes" to enable auto backuping classes 
$backup_tool - Defines the backup tools to activate (At leat one, can be an array)
Check tomcat/manifests/backup.pp for more info on tomcat backuping related variables.


DEPENDENCIES:
Standard classes generally don't need external modules.
Extended classes need the relevant external modules and the Example42 "common" module.
tomcat::conf generic infile configuration define needs the Example42 "common" module
