DESCRIPTION:
This module installs and manages collectd.
Standard and extended classes are available.
Decide and customize how you want to define configuration files: static files, templates, infile modifications...


USER VARIABLES:
In order to customize the behaviour of the module you can set the following variables:
$collectd_server (default: "collectd") - Defines the hostname of the collectd server
$collectd_server_local (default: not set) - Defines if the local node is a collectd server.
   Note that it's automatically set to true if $collectd_server = $fqdn
$collectd_port (default: "25826") - Defines the port to be used by collectd server



USAGE:
# Standard Classes 
include collectd              # Install and run collectd 

include collectd::disable     # Disable collectd service.
include collectd::disableboot # Disable collectd service at boot time, but don't stop if it's running.
include collectd::absent      # Remove collectd package.

# Extended Classes (generally require storeconfigs)
include collectd::monitor     # Monitor collectd - Automatically included if $monitor=yes - Requires Example42's monitor module
include collectd::backup      # Backup collectd data - Automatically included if $backup=yes - Requires Example42's backup module
include collectd::firewall    # Manages firewall rule for collectd service - Automatically included if $firewall=yes - Requires Example42's firewall module

# Generic define to set parameters in the main configuration file. EXPERIMENTAL.
collectd::conf { "ParameterName": value="YourValue"} # Generic 

# Module specific classes

# Module specific defines
collectd::plugin { "pluginname":  } # Loads the specified plugin. Note that a omonimous template must exist
                                    # A set of standard plugins is autoloaded by (automatic) collectd::plugins class 

GENERAL VARIABLES:
Example42 modules collection uses some general variables that can influence the behaviour of this module.
You can happily live without considering or setting them, but they can be useful to manage different projects maintanining the module's resuability. 
$my_project - If set, permits you to alter and customize the module behaviour
  and files's deploy logic in custom project classes than can be placed in a separated module.   
$base_source - Let you define an alternative source for static files:
  - $base_source not set -> Files are looked in puppet://$servername/ (the PuppetMaster)
  - $base_source set -> Files are looked in $base_source ( could be puppet://$servername/$my_module ) 
  Note that the module automatically manages the different paths for Puppet pre 0.25
  

DEPENDENCIES:
Standard classes generally don't need external modules.
Extended classes need the relevant external modules (import monitor ; import backup ... ) and the "common" module (import common)
collectd::conf generic infile configuration define needs the "common" module
Check on individual module specific classes and defines if there are specific requirements.
