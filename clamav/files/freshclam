## When changing the periodicity of freshclam runs in the crontab,
## this value must be adjusted also. Its value is the timespan between
## two subsequent freshclam runs in minutes. E.g. for the default
##
## | 0 */3 * * *  ...
##
## crontab line, the value is 180 (minutes).
# FRESHCLAM_MOD=

## A predefined value for the delay in seconds. By default, the value is
## calculated by the 'hostid' program. This predefined value guarantees
## constant timespans of 3 hours between two subsequent freshclam runs.
##
## This option accepts two special values:
## 'disabled-warn'  ...  disables the automatic freshclam update and
##                         gives out a warning
## 'disabled'       ...  disables the automatic freshclam silently
# FRESHCLAM_DELAY=


### !!!!! REMOVE ME !!!!!!
### REMOVE ME: By default, the freshclam update is disabled to avoid
### REMOVE ME: network access without prior activation
#FRESHCLAM_DELAY=disabled-warn  # REMOVE ME
