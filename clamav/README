DESCRIPTION:
This module installs and manages clamav.
Standard and extended classes are available.
Decide and customize how you want to define configation files: static files, templates, infile modifications...


USAGE:
# Standard Classes 
include clamav              # Install and run clamav with standard configurations.
include clamav::disable     # Disable clamav service.
include clamav::disableboot # Disable clamav service at boot time, but doesn't check if it's running
include clamav::absent      # Remove clamav package.

# Extended Classes (require storeconfings)
include clamav::monitor     # Monitor clamav  Automatically included if $monitor=yes
include clamav::backup      # Backup clamav data - Automatically included if $backup=yes
include clamav::firewall    # Manages firewall rule for clamav service - Automatically included if $firewall=yes

# Extra Classes

# Generic main configuration infile modification Define
clamav::conf { "ParameterName": value="YourValue"} 

# Extra Defines


DEPENDENCIES:
Standard classes generally don't need external modules.
Extended classes need the relevant external modules (import monitor ; import backup ... ) and the "common" module (import common)
clamav::conf generic infile configuration define needs the "common" module
Check on individual Extra classes and defines if there are specific requirements (generally only the common module).
