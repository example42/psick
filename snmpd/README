DESCRIPTION:
This module installs and manages snmpd.
Standard and extended classes are available.
Decide and customize how you want to define configuration files: static files, templates, infile modifications...


USER VARIABLES:
TODO: Prepare templates for use of specifi variables such as snmpd_version, snmpd_ro_community ...


USAGE:
# Standard Classes 
include snmpd              # Install and run snmpd 

include snmpd::disable     # Disable snmpd service.
include snmpd::disableboot # Disable snmpd service at boot time, but don't stop if it's running.
include snmpd::absent      # Remove snmpd package.

# Extended Classes (generally require storeconfigs)
include snmpd::monitor     # Monitor snmpd - Automatically included if $monitor=yes - Requires Example42's monitor module
include snmpd::backup      # Backup snmpd data - Automatically included if $backup=yes - Requires Example42's backup module
include snmpd::firewall    # Manages firewall rule for snmpd service - Automatically included if $firewall=yes - Requires Example42's firewall module

# Generic define to set parameters in the main configuration file. EXPERIMENTAL.
snmpd::conf { "ParameterName": value="YourValue"} # Generic 

# Module specific classes

# Module specific defines


GENERAL VARIABLES:
Example42 modules collection uses some general variables that can influence the behaviour of this module.
You can happily live without considering or setting them, but they can be useful to manage different projects maintanining the module's resuability. 
$my_project - If set, permits you to alter and customize the module behaviour
  and files's deploy logic in custom project classes than can be placed in a separated module.   
$base_source - Let you define an alternative source for static files:
  - $base_source not set -> Files are looked in puppet://$servername/ (the PuppetMaster)
  - $base_source set -> Files are looked in $base_source ( could be puppet://$servername/$my_module ) 
  Note that the module automatically manages the different paths for Puppet pre 0.25
  

DEPENDENCIES:
Standard classes generally don't need external modules.
Extended classes need the relevant external modules (import monitor ; import backup ... ) and the "common" module (import common)
snmpd::conf generic infile configuration define needs the "common" module
Check on individual module specific classes and defines if there are specific requirements.
