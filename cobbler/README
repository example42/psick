Puppet module: cobbler

# Written by Lab42 #
# http://www.Example42.com

Licence: Apache2

DESCRIPTION:
This module installs and manages cobbler.
It's based on Example42's module structure and features standard and
extended classes for automatic monitoring, backup and firewalling.

All the variables used in this module are defined in the cobbler::params class
(File: $MODULEPATH/cobbler/manifests/params.pp). Here you can:
- Set default settings and filtering module's specific Users variables
- Add selectors for internal variables to adapt the module to different OSes
- Review and eventually change default settings for variables that affect the
  Example42 extended classes.

Customizations for different projects and logic on how to populate configuration
files should be placed in the $my_project classes.


MODULE'S SPECIFIC USER VARIABLES:


USAGE:
# Standard Classes 
include cobbler              # Install and run cobbler 

include cobbler::disable     # Disable cobbler service.
include cobbler::disableboot # Disable cobbler service at boot time, but don't stop if is running.
include cobbler::absent      # Remove cobbler package.
include cobbler::debug       # Used for debugging purposes (not resource hungry)
                         # Automatically included if $debug=yes
                         # Requires Example42's puppet::params and puppet::debug

# Extended Classes
include cobbler::puppi       # Puppi extensions for the cobbler module
                         # Requires Example42's puppi module
include cobbler::monitor     # Monitor cobbler
                         # Automatically included if $monitor=yes
                         # Requires Example42's monitor module
include cobbler::backup      # Backup cobbler data
                         # Automatically included if $backup=yes
                         # Requires Example42's backup module
include cobbler::firewall    # Manages firewall rules for cobbler service
                         # Automatically included if $firewall=yes
                         # Requires Example42's firewall module

# Generic define to set parameters in the main configuration file. EXPERIMENTAL.

EXAMPLE42 GENERAL VARIABLES:
Example42 modules collection uses some general variables that can influence the
behaviour of this module. You can happily live without considering or setting them,
but they can be useful to get many useful features out of the box.
$my_project - If set, permits you to alter and customize the module behaviour
  and files's deploy logic in custom project classes than can be placed in a separated module.   
$base_source - Lets you define an alternative source for static files:
  - $base_source not set -> Files are looked in puppet://$servername/ (the PuppetMaster)
  - $base_source set -> Files are in $base_source ( Ex: puppet://$servername/$my_module ) 
  Note that the module automatically manages the different paths for Puppet pre 0.25
$debug - If set to yes writes in /var/lib/puppet/debug/ useful debugging info

VARIABLES FOR EXTENDED MODULES:
$puppi - Set to "yes" to enable cobbler plugins for puppi
Check cobbler/manifests/puppi.pp for more info.

$monitor - Set to "yes" to enable auto monitoring classes 
$monitor_tool - Defines the monitor tools to activate (At leat one, can be an array)
Check cobbler/manifests/monitor.pp for more info on cobbler monitoring related variables.

$backup - Set to "yes" to enable auto backuping classes 
$backup_tool - Defines the backup tools to activate (At leat one, can be an array)
Check cobbler/manifests/backup.pp for more info on cobbler backuping related variables.

$firewall - Set to "yes" to enable auto firewalling classes
$firewall_tool - Defines the firewall tools to activate
Check cobbler/manifests/firewall.pp for more info on cobbler firewalling related variables.


DEPENDENCIES:
Standard classes generally don't need external modules.
Extended classes need the relevant external modules.
cobbler::conf generic infile configuration define needs the Example42 "common" module
