DESCRIPTION:
This module installs and manages openssh.
Standard and extended classes are available.

USER VARIABLES:
In order to customize the behaviour of the module you can set the following variables:


USAGE:
# Standard Classes 
include openssh              # Install and run openssh daemon (it also includes openssh::client)
include openssh::client      # Install only openssh client 
include openssh::disable     # Disable openssh service.
include openssh::disableboot # Disable openssh service at boot time, but don't stop if it's running.
include openssh::absent      # Remove openssh package.

# Extended Classes (require storeconfings)
include openssh::monitor     # Monitor openssh  Automatically included if $monitor=yes
include openssh::backup      # Backup openssh data - Automatically included if $backup=yes
include openssh::firewall    # Manages firewall rule for openssh service - Automatically included if $firewall=yes

# Extra Classes

# Generic main configuration infile modification Define
openssh::conf { "ParameterName": value="YourValue"} 

# Extra Defines


DEPENDENCIES:
Standard classes generally don't need external modules.
Extended classes need the relevant external modules (import monitor ; import backup ... ) and the "common" module (import common)
openssh::conf generic infile configuration define needs the "common" module
Check on individual Extra classes and defines if there are specific requirements (generally only the common module).
