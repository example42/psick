## Description:		Information about your timezone and time
# File managed by Puppet

# Be aware that the time reference of the CMOS/HW clock has been
# forwarded to /etc/adjtime, the file used by hwclock(8),
# systemd(1), and the kernel as reference for the CMOS/HW clock.

## Type:		list(yes,no,)
## Description:		Write back system time to the hardware clock
#
# Is set to "yes" write back the system time to the hardware
# clock at reboot or shutdown. Usefull if hardware clock is
# much more inaccurate than system clock.  Set to "no" if
# system time does it wrong due e.g. missed timer interrupts.
# If set to "no" the hardware clock adjust feature is also
# skipped because it is rather useless without writing back
# the system time to the hardware clock.
#
# Note that you need to enable boot.clock for this feature to take
# effect.
#
# defaults to 'yes' if unset

## Type:		list(yes,no,)
## Description:		Do or do not not run hwclock(8)
#
# Set this to yes if it is possible to access the hardware clock,

# overwritten by the service its self.

## Type:		list(yes,no,)
## Description:		Correct systematic drift of the HW clock
#
# Add or subtract time from the Hardware Clock to account for
# systematic drift since the last time the clock was set or
# adjusted. By default off as this can cause trouble.  For
# systems using localtime for HW clock this will ignored.
