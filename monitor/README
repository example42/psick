Puppet abstraction module: monitor

Licence: Apache2

Goal of this module:
A Puppet infrastructure where whenever you add nodes and services these are AUTOMATICALLY checked
by your preferred monitor tool: Nagios, Cacti, Munin, Collectd...
Where you can do this seamlessly and without any extra work (Plug & Play)..
Where you can introduce a new monitor tool, configure its "connectors" in a single place and have automatically
all the resources you are already monitoring included in your new tool.

DESCRIPTION:
This module abstracts the monitoring definitions for an host or application, in order to add
and use different monitoring methods, without changes on the single application modules.
It's used in the Example42 modules by the monitor "extended" classes (autoloaded if $monitor=yes)
as a way to automatically monitor the resources provided by the module.
This monitor module is an implementation of a monitoring abstaction layer that provides:
- a common interface for different monitoring tools (Nagios, Monit, Munin....)
- an unified syntax for monitoring resources able to adapt to monitoring modules from different authors
- a standard way to define what an application or an host needs to be monitored
- reversable actions (you can remove a monitor resource previously defined)

USAGE
All the Example42 modules based on the "foo" template (a standardized module layout which can be quickly
cloned into a new module) have a foo::monitor class. This is good example of how to use this module:

class foo::monitor {

    include foo::params

    # Port monitoring
    monitor::port { "foo_${foo::params::protocol}_${foo::params::port}": 
        protocol => "${foo::params::protocol}",
        port     => "${foo::params::port}",
        target   => "${foo::params::monitor_target_real}",
        enable   => "${foo::params::monitor_port_enable}",
        tool     => "${monitor_tool}",
    }
    
    # URL monitoring 
    monitor::url { "foo_url":
        url      => "${foo::params::monitor_baseurl_real}/index.php",
        pattern  => "${foo::params::monitor_url_pattern}",
        enable   => "${foo::params::monitor_url_enable}",
        tool     => "${monitor_tool}",
    }

    # Process monitoring 
    monitor::process { "foo_process":
        process  => "${foo::params::processname}",
        service  => "${foo::params::servicename}",
        pidfile  => "${foo::params::pidfile}",
        enable   => "${foo::params::monitor_process_enable}",
        tool     => "${monitor_tool}",
    }

}

Some notes:
- It's not necessary to use qualified variables (such as ${foo::params::processname} ) you  can provide direct values
- Currently 4 monitor defines are available: process, url, port and plugin (to be used is special cases).
- You can obviously use the monitor::process, monitor::port, monitor::url wherever you want, in dedicated classes or not.
- With the variable "monitor_tool" (which can be an array) you define what monitor tools you want to use.

On the servers you just have to include the relevant tool module.
For example, on the central Nagios server just
include nagios.
If you want all the monitor servers on the same node, you can just:
include monitor::server.
If you want to monitor, generically, a node you can:
include monitor::target
Note that this is generally not necessary, since the relevant classes are autoloaded when you use one of their defines.

MANAGING EXCEPTIONS
You can fine control what you want to monitor.
There are some "node-wide" variables you can set:
# $monitor_port (true|false) : Set if you want to enable port monitoring for the host.
# $monitor_url (true|false) : Set if you want to enable url checkig.
# $monitor_process (true|false) : Set if you want to enable process monitoring.
# $monitor_plugin (true|false) : Set if you want to try to use specific plugins of your monitoring tools 
# $monitor_target : Set the ip/hostname you want to use on an external monitoring server to monitor the host
# $monitor_baseurl : Set baseurl to use for eventual URL checks of services provided by this host
These variables can be overriden on a per-module basis (needed, for example if you want to enable process monitoring for some service but not all):
# $foo_monitor_port (true|false) : Set if you want to monitor foo's port(s). If any. Default: As defined in $monitor_port
# $foo_monitor_url (true|false) : Set if you want to monitor foo's url(s). If any. Default: As defined in $monitor_url
# $foo_monitor_process (true|false) : Set if you want to monitor foo's process. If any. Default: As defined in $monitor_process
# $foo_monitor_plugin (true|false) : Set if you want to monitor foo using specific monitor tool's plugin  i   s. If any. Default: As defined in $monitor_plugin
# $foo_monitor_target : Define how to reach (Ip, fqdn...) the host to monitor foo from an external server. Default: As defined in $monitor_target
# $foo_monitor_url : Define the baseurl (http://$fqdn/...) to use for eventual foo URL checks. Default: As defined in $monitor_url

You can finally define what monitor tool to use on each monitor define using the tool parameter.


MONITOR MODULE LAYOUT
This monitor module is to be considered a (working) implementation, entirely based on Puppet's DSL of a
(strongly needed) monitor abstraction type.
It prefers linearity and extendability over performance, so it might be overwhelming in large installations
(it's currently in production with 3 different monitoring tools on about 80 nodes, which are going to grow to about 300).
You can try to achieve the same result in pure Ruby language with custom types and providers
The generic monitor defines are placed in files like:
monitor/manifests/process.pp, monitor/manifests/port.pp, monitor/manifests/url.pp
here according to the tool requested are called some specific defines (note that for the ones not yet implemented is just placed a debug file),
that are configured in places like:
monitor/manifests/process/nagios.pp, monitor/manifests/process/monit.pp where the actual defines that "do" the work are called.
Note that here you can choose different implementations of the a specific module, so you are free to change the whole module to be used
for a specific monitoring toolediting just these few files.  

DEPENDENCIES:
This is a meta-module that needs dependencies according to the modules you use.
You must have storeconfigs enabled to use monitoring tools like Nagios, but they are not necessary for tools
that can be entirely configured on the same host (such as Monit).
