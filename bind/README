Puppet module: bind

DESCRIPTION:
This module installs and manages bind.
It's based on Example42's module structure and features standard and
extended classes for automatic monitoring, backup and firewalling.

All the variables used in this module are defined in the bind::params class
(File: $MODULEPATH/bind/manifests/params.pp). Here you can:
- Set default settings and filtering module's specific Users variables
- Add selectors for internal variables to adapt the module to different OSes
- Review and eventually change default settings for variables that affect the
  Example42 extended classes.

Customizations for different projects and logic on how to populate configuration
files should be placed in the $my_project classes.


MODULE'S SPECIFIC USER VARIABLES:
$bind_config # Define how you want to manage named.conf:
             # "file" - To provide named.conf as a normal template
             # "concat" - To build up named.conf using different fragments (default)
$bind_servertype # Define what kind of server installation you want
                 # "master" - Master server. Authoritative for at least a zone.
                 # "slave" - Slave server. Authoritative for at least a zone.
                 # "cache" - Caching only nameserver. Not autoritative. (default)
$bind_chroot # Define if you want to install bind-chroot packages (only on RedHat/Centos)
$bind_log # Define if you want to log on syslog or custom file ($logdir/bind.log)
$bind_forwarders # Define global forwarders (Can be an array)
$bind_also_notify # # Define global slaves to notify (option also-notify) 
$bind_clients # Define (in named.conf address_match_element format) the clients that can use
              # this server for queries. Can be an array. Default: localhost
$bind_slaves # Define (in named.conf address_match_element format) the clients that can use
             # this server for zone-transfers. Can be an array. Default: localhost
             # Note that this parameter only affects the acl that is permitted for zone 
             # transfers, if you need to notify your slaves, use (also) $bind_also_notify 
USAGE:
# Standard Classes 
include bind              # Install and run bind 

include bind::disable     # Disable bind service.
include bind::disableboot # Disable bind service at boot time, but don't stop if is running.
include bind::absent      # Remove bind package.
include bind::debug       # Used for debugging purposes (not resource hungry)
                         # Automatically included if $debug=yes
                         # Requires Example42's puppet::params and puppet::debug

# Extended Classes (generally require storeconfigs)
include bind::monitor     # Monitor bind
                         # Automatically included if $monitor=yes
                         # Requires Example42's monitor module
include bind::backup      # Backup bind data
                         # Automatically included if $backup=yes
                         # Requires Example42's backup module
include bind::firewall    # Manages firewall rules for bind service
                         # Automatically included if $firewall=yes
                         # Requires Example42's firewall module

# Generic define to set parameters in the main configuration file. EXPERIMENTAL.
bind::conf { "ParameterName": value="YourValue"} # Generic 

# Module specific classes

# Module specific defines
bind::zone # Adds a custom bind zone, as concat fragment, to named.conf 

EXAMPLE42 GENERAL VARIABLES:
Example42 modules collection uses some general variables that can influence the
behaviour of this module. You can happily live without considering or setting them,
but they can be useful to get many useful features out of the box.
$my_project - If set, permits you to alter and customize the module behaviour
  and files's deploy logic in custom project classes than can be placed in a separated module.   
$base_source - Lets you define an alternative source for static files:
  - $base_source not set -> Files are looked in puppet://$servername/ (the PuppetMaster)
  - $base_source set -> Files are in $base_source ( Ex: puppet://$servername/$my_module ) 
  Note that the module automatically manages the different paths for Puppet pre 0.25
$debug - If set to yes writes in /var/lib/puppet/debug/ useful debugging info

VARIABLES FOR EXTENDED MODULES:
$monitor - Set to "yes" to enable auto monitoring classes 
$monitor_tool - Defines the monitor tools to activate (At leat one, can be an array)
Check bind/manifests/monitor.pp for more info on bind monitoring related variables.

$backup - Set to "yes" to enable auto backuping classes 
$backup_tool - Defines the backup tools to activate (At leat one, can be an array)
Check bind/manifests/backup.pp for more info on bind backuping related variables.


DEPENDENCIES:
Standard classes generally don't need external modules.
Extended classes need the relevant external modules and the Example42 "common" module.
bind::conf generic infile configuration define needs the Example42 "common" module
