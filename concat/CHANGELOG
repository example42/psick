KNOWN ISSUES:
- In 0.24.8 you will see inintended notifies, if you build a file
  in a run, the next run will also see it as changed.  This is due
  to how 0.24.8 does the purging of unhandled files, this is improved
  in 0.25.x and we cannot work around it in our code.

CHANGELOG:
- 2010/02/19 - initial release
- 2010/03/12 - add support for 0.24.8 and newer
             - make the location of sort configurable
             - add the ability to add shell comment based warnings to
               top of files
             - add the ablity to create empty files
- 2010/04/05 - fix parsing of WARN and change code style to match rest
               of the code
             - Better and safer boolean handling for warn and force
             - Don't use hard coded paths in the shell script, set PATH
               top of the script
             - Use file{} to copy the result and make all fragments owned
               by root.  This means we can chnage the ownership/group of the
               resulting file at any time.
             - You can specify ensure => "/some/other/file" in concat::fragment
               to include the contents of a symlink into the final file.
- 2010/04/16 - Add more cleaning of the fragment name - removing / from the $name
- 2010/05/22 - Improve documentation and show the use of ensure =>
- 2010/07/14 - Add support for setting the filebucket behavior of files
- 2010/10/04 - Make the warning message configurable
- 2010/12/03 - Add flags to make concat work better on Solaris - thanks Jonathan Boyett
