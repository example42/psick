## Installation

### Control-repo setup from GitHub:

Download this repository:

    git clone https://github.com/example42/control-repo
    cd control-repo

To setup or verify the presence of the needed prerequisites just execute the script:

    bin/puppet_setup.sh

If you have Fabric installed local you can use Fabric for initial setup (and many other operations):

    fab puppet.setup
    
### Single example42 Puppet modules

Use the Forge to install single example42 modules (be aware of the deprecated or old (2.x) ones):

    puppet module search example42

or cherry pick them from [GitHub](https://github.com/example42).

### Old versions installation

You can retrieve the old lists of Example42 modules from other versions with:

    git clone --recursive -b 1.0 git://github.com/example42/control-repo.git
    git clone --recursive -b 2.0 git://github.com/example42/control-repo.git
    git clone --recursive -b 3.0 git://github.com/example42/control-repo.git

Note that earlier versions are based on git modules and have not a control-repo structure.


## Common tasks via Fabric

Many useful and common activities related to Puppet code development, testing and deployment can be fulfilled using Fabric. Many Fabric tasks use shell commands and scripts you can invoke directly, if preferred.

Show available Fabric tasks (note: some will be run locally, some on the hosts specified via -H):

    fab -l

Run a Fabric task (better to do this from the main repo directory):

    fab <task>[:host=<hostname>][,option=value]

### Puppet tasks

Run puppet agent in noop mode on all the known hosts:

    fab puppet.agent_noop

Run puppet agent in a specific node:

    fab puppet.agent:host=web01.example.test

Show the current version of deployed Puppet code on all  nodes:

    fab puppet.current_config

Generate a new module based on the format of the ```skeleton``` directory.

    fab puppet.module_generate

### Docker tasks

The control repo provides various ways to use, configure and work with Docker.

To build the images for testing this control-repo on Docker using different OS.
Note: image building is based on the data in ```hieradata/role/docker_multios_build.yaml``` edit ```docker::profile::builder``` keys to customise what you want to build:

    fab docker.multios_build

Test a specific role on specific OS Docker images via Puppet.
Available images are: (ubuntu-12.04, ubuntu-14.04, ubuntu-14.06, centos-7, debian-7, debian-8, alpine-3.3).
Note that by default they are downloaded from [https://hub.docker.com/r/example42/puppet-agent/tags/](https://hub.docker.com/r/example42/puppet-agent/tags/).
If you change the parameter ```docker::username``` (Here is example42 by default) you will have first to build (with ```fab docker.multios_build```) puppet-agent images and, eventually, push them to the registry.

    fab docker.provision:log,ubuntu-14.04
    fab docker.provision:puppetrole=log,image=ubuntu-14.04 # This has the same effect


### Vagrant tasks

This contro-repo contains different Vagrant environments for different purposes.

You can work with then directly issuing ```vagrant``` commands in ```vagrant/environments/<env_name>``` or via Fabric from the main repo dir.

Run vagrant status on all the available Vagrant environments

    fab vagrant.all_status

Run vagrant provision on all the running vm of a Vagrant environment:

    fab vagrant.provision:env=puppetinfra

Run vagrant up on the given vm:

    fab vagrant.up:vm=dev-local-docker-build-01


### AWS tasks

Some basic taskes are available to work on AWS. To install locally AWS cli and other tools used in the control-repo, and then configure the AWS credentials:

    fab aws.setup

To show the status of AWS resources, mapped by puppet resources on all or a specified region:

    fab aws.status             # Cycle on all regions
    fab aws.status:eu-west-1   # Show the specified region's resources

To run Puppet apply locally and setup AWS resources using the role 'aws' (configured in ```hieradata/role/aws.yaml``` (WARNING: AWS costs may incur here)

    fab aws.apply


### Git tasks

Install useful git hooks for Puppet files checking. By default downloaded from (https://github.com/drwahl/puppet-git-hooks)[https://github.com/drwahl/puppet-git-hooks]:

    fab git.install_hooks

It's possible to specify the git repo url to use (hooks are looked for in the ```commit_hooks``` directory):

    fab git.install_hooks:url=https://github.com/my/puppet-git-hooks

Note that existing git hooks are not overwritten by this task.

To quickly check the git status of the main control-repo and of the other eventual modules, run:

    fab git.status


## Dependencies

To have a full working environment you might need to locally install some software for specific activities.


### Single Modules

All the modules have a ```metadata.json``` file where dependencies are described.

Most of the modules require PuppetLabs' stdlib.
Some modules (the ones, of generation 2.x, which use the ```params_lookup``` function) require Puppi.

### Control repo

The modules used (and some example42 other)  in this control repo are defined in the ```Puppetfile``` and can be installed manually via git, from the Forge or via r10k.

To install r10k:

    gem install r10k

To install Fabric you can use the local package providers or pip (you might need to install also the ecdsa package):

    pip install fabric
    pip install ecdsa

### Vagrant

For a correct setup of the Vagrant environment you need some extra plugins:

    vagrant plugin install vagrant-cachier
    vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
    vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostmanager

### Docker

Docker operations via Fabric or using the command line require Docker to be locally installed.

If you use Mac or Windows you need the newer native client, things won't work when using Docker running inside a Virtualbox VM.

You'll need to run ```docker login``` before trying any operation that involves pushing your images to Docker registry.


## Example42 modules evolution

There are currently 4 generations of example42 modules:

* "OLD" modules (Version 1.x) are no more supported or recommended.
  They are supposed to work also on Puppet versions 0.x.
  You can give them a look using the 1.0 branch of this repo.

* "NextGen" modules (Version 2.x) were made before the release of Puppet 3.
  They are compatible with Puppet version 2.6 , 3 and, for most, 4.
  They were linked as git submodules.

* "StdMod" modules (Version 3.x) were supposed to be the next evolution of Example42 modules.
  They adhere to StdMod naming standards and be compatible with Puppet > 2.7 or 3.x
  This is an half baked generation, which was abandoned for other projects.

* Version 4.x modules. Most of the old pre-Puppet 4 modules have been deprecated and not maintained anymore.
  They are Puppet 4 only compliant.
  The structure of the repo has changed radically, all the git submodules have been removed and a
  control-repo style has been introduced.
  With the release of 4.x this repo has been renamed: from **puppet-modules** to **control-repo**.


## Using and understanding this control-repo

The control-repo you find here is what we consider a starting point for a state of the art general purpose Puppet setup.

It's based on a nodeless classification, driven by 3 top scope variables:

  - ```$::role``` - Defines the nodes' role
  - ```$::env``` - Defines the nodes' operational environment
  - ```$::zone``` - Defines the datacenter or region or segment of an infrastructure (optional)

These variables are used in the Hiera's hierarchy (check ```hiera.yaml```) and should be enough to classify univocally any node in a averagely complex infrastructure. Here they are set as external facts (you'll need to set them when provisioning your nodes, as it's done in the Vagrant environment).

The manifests file, ```manifests/site.pp``` sets some resource defaults, includes a baseline profile according to the underlying OS and uses hiera to define what profiles have to be included in each role (a more traditional alternative, based on role classes, is possible).

All the Hiera data is in ```hieradata``` , the file ```hiera.yaml``` shows a possible hierarchy design and uses ```hiera-eyaml``` as backend for keys encryption (no key is currently encrypted, because we are not shipping the generated private key (it's in .gitignore).
You will have to regenerate your hiera-eyaml keys (run, from the main repo dir, ```eyaml createkeys```).

In the ```site``` directory there are local "not public" modules. Basically our profiles and some role examples.

In the ```modules``` directory are placed the public modules, as defined in the ```Puppetfile``` and installed via r10k or librarian-puppet.

The ```vagrant``` directory contains different Vagrant environments with the relevant toolset that can be used to test the same control-repo.
They are fully customizable by editing the ```config.yaml``` file.

The ```skeleton``` directory contains a module skeleton you can use, and modify, to generate new modules based on the skeleton structure.
