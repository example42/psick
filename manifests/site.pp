# This is the default manifest used in Vagrant and PuppetMaster environments.

# Here we have a sample $::role driven nodeless setup with a common base profile
# a additional classes (profiles) set on Hiera.
# The $::role variable, useful for classification in Hiera, can be set in different ways:
# - As an external fact defined during provisioning
# - Via a ENC like The Foreman or Puppet Enterprise
# - In this same site.pp, extracting the role information from the hostname
# - In this same site.pp, setting the $role var based on pp_role trusted fact
# The latter choice is what is used here, feel free to modify and adapt to your case.

### SETTING TOP SCOPE VARIABLES USED IN HIERA.YAML
# The following lines are used to assign to top-scope variables (used in
# hiera.yaml) the values of eventual trusted facts.
# More info: https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/latest/reference/ssl_attributes_extensions.html
# You may need to change and adapt them according to your hiera.yaml
# You can keep them also if you don't set extended trusted facts.

  $role = $ec2_tag_role
}

  $env = $ec2_tag_env

  $host_name = $ec2_tag_name

    $application = $trusted['extensions']['pp_application']
  }
  # Note: with the above settings we allow overriding of our trusted facts by normal facts.
  # This is done here to adapt to different approaches, if you use trusted facts
  # you will probably want to change the above into something like:
  # if $trusted['extensions']['pp_role'] {
  #   $role = $trusted['extensions']['pp_role']
  # }
