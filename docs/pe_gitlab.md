## Puppet Enterprise (PE) and Gitlab integration

Deep and powerful integrations are possible in this `control-repo` between `Puppet Enterprise` and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/).

Here we review what is done in this `control-repo` and the manual steps for a fully `PE-GitLab` integrated environment:

  - `Puppet Code Manager` integration between `GitLab` and `PE`
  - `Puppet` profiles to configure `gitlab` and `gitlab runners`
  - `Gitlab CI` integration with `Puppet` controlled via the ```.gitlab-ci.yml``` file.
  - `PE` based `Vagrant` environment where to test the full integration

### Puppet Code Manager deployments automation

It's possible to configure `PE's Code Manager` to automatically deploy code on the `Puppet Server` when any change occurs in a `control-repo` hosted on `GitLab`.


### Configure Code Manager

To configure `Code Manager` integration with `GitLab` follow [official documentation](https://docs.puppet.com/pe/latest/code_mgr_config.html).

In short, set these keys via `Hiera` or manually on the `PE console` on the `Puppet Server` of `Masters node` (or the `Puppet Server` in a AIO setup):

    # Url of the control repo hosted on the internal GitLab server
    puppet_enterprise::profile::master::r10k_remote: git@git.lan:puppet/control-repo.git'

    # Path of a ssh private key able to access the repo. File should be owned by pe-puppet user.
    puppet_enterprise::profile::master::r10k_private_key: '/etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/ssh/id-control_repo.rsa'

    # Enable Code Manager auto deployment
    puppet_enterprise::profile::master::code_manager_auto_configure: true

In additional to `PE` original module you can automate the `PE user` creation and tokens generation with data as:

    ---
    psick::profiles::linux_classes:
      'code_manager': profile::puppet::pe_code_manager

    psick::puppet::pe_code_manager::pe_user: 'deployer'        # A user you've created on PE
    psick::puppet::pe_code_manager::pe_password: 'deployer'    # PE user password. TOCRYPT. Here in cleartext for demo only.
    psick::puppet::pe_code_manager::pe_email: 'root@localhost' # PE user email.


#### [Manual] steps needed

  - Create a **new** repo for your `control-repo` on `GitLab`
  - Create a user for deployments on `GitLab` (i.e. deployer), be sure it can access (at least in read only) your `control-repo`
  - Copy the key generated by ```psick::puppet::pe_code_manager``` in ```/etc/puppetlabs/ssh/id-control_repo.rsa``` as `public key` of the deployer user on `GitLab`.
  - [auto] On `PE Console` create a user and assign it to the `Code Deployers role` (see below for details)
  - [auto] On the `Puppet Server` request an authentication token (see below for details) to use for deployments
  - On `GitLab` add the created `PE token` to your project's [Webhooks](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/webhooks.html#overview).

The class ```psick::puppet::pe_code_manager``` automates some of the above steps (the ones with [auto] prefix)


##### Create a deploy user on PE console

Manual user creation on `PE console` (not necessary if class ```psick::puppet::pe_code_manager``` is used):

  - Click: Access Control -> Users -> Add local user (Specify Full Name and login)
  - Click: User -> Edit user -> Generate Password reset
  - Copy the link for password reset and open it with a browser to the the user password.
  - To assign a new role to the user click User Roles -> Selected role -> Add user (Select from menu the User name)

Check [here](https://docs.puppet.com/pe/latest/rbac_user_roles.html) for more details on `PE user` roles.

For `Code Manager` is enough to assign the created user to the `Code Deployers` role.

##### Request an authentication token

`PE` allows the usage of tokens to manage access to its APIs. Check [Token Based Authentication](https://docs.puppet.com/pe/latest/rbac_token_auth.html) for more details.

Also the following manual steps can be automated by using and configuring ```psick::puppet::pe_code_manager```.

To create a token of a local system user we can use the ```puppet-access``` command.

It's configuration file is in ```/etc/puppetlabs/client-tools/puppet-access.conf``` a sample command to request an authentication token (which lasts 5 years) is:

    puppet-access login --lifetime 5y

You are asked to introduce a login and a password, use the credentials of the `PE user` for which you want to create the token (which will have the access privileges of the username used in ```puppet-access```).

`Token` is stored in ```~/.puppetlabs/token```, to view activities done using the `Token`, in the `PE console`, click Access control > Users > Selected user > Details > Activity tab.

To manage tokens default lifetime, on the `PE console` node (**NOTE:** the default value is just 5 minutes):

  puppet_enterprise::profile::console::rbac_token_auth_lifetime: 10y

**NOTE:** The `control-repo` provides the define ```psick::puppet::access``` to automate `Token requests` (you need to provide `PE username` and `password`).

`Tokens` used for `Code Deployment` have to be added in `GitLab's project` [webhooks](https://docs.puppet.com/pe/latest/code_mgr_webhook.html).

URLs added on `gitlab` has the following format:

    https://<pe_console_hostname>:8170/code-manager/v1/webhook?type=gitlab&token=<puppet_access_token>


### Puppet profiles for GitLab components

The `psick` module provides some [class](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/lang_classes.html) and [defines](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/lang_defined_types.html) to work with `GitLab`:

  - ```psick::gitlab``` installs `GitLab` and eventually creates `projects`, `groups` and `users` (WIP)
  - ```psick::gitlab::runner``` installs a `GitLab runner` (one or more instances)
  - ```psick::gitlab::proxy``` configures `Nginx` to act as a reverse proxy of a remote `GitLab server`
  - ```psick::gitlab::cli``` installs `GitLab cli` and configures its access credentials via a custom ```/etc/gitlab-cli.conf``` file
  - ```psick::gitlab::ci``` creates the ```/etc/gitlab-ci.conf``` used by some scripts in the `CI pipeline`
  - ```psick::gitlab::runner``` define used to create a `GitLab runner` instance
  - ```psick::gitlab::user``` define used to create a `GitLab user`
  - ```psick::gitlab::group``` define used to create a `GitLab group`
  - ```psick::gitlab::project``` define used to create a `GitLab project`

## Puppet CI integration on Gitlab

Setup of a fully integrated `CI pipeline` for `Puppet` deployments via `GitLab` is possible using local profiles, tools and scripts.
At the moment this setup is not completely automated, some steps (user creation on `PE` and `GitLab`, secrets setting and configuration).


### GitLab Merge Requests and approvals

In the `pipelines` you may use the commands ```bin/gitlab_create_merge_request.rb``` and ```bin/gitlab_accept_merge_request.rb``` to automate the remote managements of `GitLab` `Merge Requests`.

These scripts use the ```/etc/gitlab-cli.conf``` file generated by the ```psick::gitlab::cli``` class.

You configure it with something like:

    psick::gitlab::cli::private_token: '9C2xPzg9V22Ha3TdsQpx'  # This changes at every psick installationn
    psick::gitlab::cli::api_endpoint: 'https://git.lan/api/v3' # Use the url of your GitLab server
    psick::gitlab::cli::project_id: 3 # ID of the control-repo repo on your GitLab (TODO: be able to specify just the project name)

The `GitLab` `private token` is the one from a user that has, on `GitLab`, the permissions for the requested activities (such as `MR management`). Create a user with such privileges and then retrieve it's `Private token` from:
User Settings [Settings in the top right user icon] -> Account -> Private Token
