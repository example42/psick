## Fabric

This `control-repo` provides several tools that help Puppeteers in their daily work.

### Remote puppet commands via Fabric

Various `Fabric tasks` are available to executing on remote hosts. We will need access to them, possibly via `ssh keys`.

Install `Puppet 5` on the remote host(s). Use any `Fabric` method to define hosts to work on.

    fab puppet.install -H host1,host2

Run ```puppet agent``` in `noop mode` on all the known hosts:

    fab puppet.agent_noop

Run ```puppet agent``` in a specific node:

    fab puppet.agent:host=web01.example.test

Show the current version of deployed `Puppet code` on all nodes:

    fab puppet.current_config

Setup on the remote node all the prerequisites to run this `control-repo` in `apply mode`:

    fab puppet.remote_setup
    # or
    bin/puppet_setup.sh  #is executed on the remote node

Deploy this `control-repo` from `upstream source`:

    fab puppet.deploy_controlrepo
    # or
    bin/puppet_deploy_controlrepo.sh  #is executed on the remote node

Run ```puppet apply``` with or without noop on all the known hosts (expected `control-repo` in ```production environment```):

    fab puppet.apply
    fab puppet.apply_noop

Run in `apply mode` the local code on a remote node (code is ```rsynced``` and then compiled on the remote node.

    fab puppet.sync_and_apply

### Local Puppet activities

The following activities can be done locally during `development`, `publishing` and `deployment` of `Puppet code`.

Check the syntax of all ```.pp``` ```.yaml``` ```.epp``` ```.erb``` files in our `control-repo`:

    fab puppet.check_syntax

Generate a new module via [pdk](https://puppet.com/docs/pdk/latest/pdk.html).

    fab puppet.module_generate

Publish the local version of a module in ```modules/``` dir to `Puppet Forge` and `GitHub` ([puppet-blacksmith](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-blacksmith) setup and access to remote `git repo` required):

     fab puppet.module_publish:tinydata

### Facter tasks (WIP)

Set `external facts`

    fab facter.set_external_facts

    fab facter.set_trusted_facts
