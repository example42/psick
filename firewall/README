DESCRIPTION:
This module abstracts the firewalling definitions for an host or application, in order to add
and use different firewalling methods, without changes on the single application modules.
It's used in the Example42 modules by the firewall "extended" classes (autoloaded if $firewall=yes)
as a way to automatically firewall the resources provided by the module.
This firewall module is an implementation of a firewalling abstaction layer that provides:
- a common interface for different firewalling tools (currently only local host based iptables)
- an unified syntax for firewalling resources able to adapt to firewalling modules from different authors
- a standard way to define what an application or an host needs to be firewalled
- reversable actions (you can remove a firewall resource previously defined)

USAGE
All the Example42 modules based on the "foo" template (a standardized module layout which can be quickly
cloned into a new module) have a foo::firewall class. This is good example of how to use this module:

class foo::firewall {

    include foo::params

    firewall { "foo_${foo::params::protocol}_${foo::params::port}":
        source      => "${foo::params::firewall_source_real}",
        destination => "${foo::params::firewall_destination_real}",
        protocol    => "${foo::params::protocol}",
        port        => "${foo::params::port}",
        action      => "allow",
        direction   => "input",
        enable      => "${foo::params::firewall_enable}",
        tool        => $firewall_tool,
    }

}

Some notes:
- It's not necessary to use qualified variables (such as ${foo::params::port} ) you  can provide direct values
- You can obviously use the firewall type wherever you want, in dedicated classes or not.
- With the variable "firewall_tool" (which can be an array) you define what firewall tools you want to use.
- Currently on the "iptables" tool is supported and it manages local host based iptables.
  It doesn't need stored configs but it requires Example42's iptables module

MANAGING EXCEPTIONS
You can fine control what you want to firewall.
There are some "node-wide" variables you can set:
# $firewall_source : Set the source address to use by default ( Default 0.0.0.0/0 ).
# $firewall_destination : Set the destination addess to use by default  ( Default $ipaddress ).
# $firewall_enable : Set if you want to enable firewalling ( Default true, note that you still need to set the global variable
  $firewall to "yes"  to activate the firewall classes
The above variables that apply to a whole host, can be overriden on a per-module basis:
# $foo_firewall_source : Define the source address to use for access to the foo's port
# $foo_firewall_destination : Define the destination address to use to access to the foo's port 
# $foo_firewall_enable : Set if you want to manage firewall for foo's process. Note that generally the firewall
  classes OPEN a port for the relevant application, so if you enable firewalling but disable firewall for foo 
  you actually risk to block foo access since it's not explicitely permitted.


DEPENDENCIES:
This is a meta-module that needs Example42's iptables module to work.

EXAMPLES:
Here are some examples of variables to set and usage:
$firewall = "yes"            # Enable Example42 firewall classes
$firewall_tool = "iptables"  # Use Example42 iptables host based firewalling method
$firewall_destination = "0/0" # When you open the firewall do it on all interfaces / local addresses instead of fact's $ipaddress

$openssh_firewall_source = "10.0.42.0/24" # Permit ssh access only from the specified network
$munin_firewall_source = 10.0.42.10 # Permit munin access only from the specified host
include iptables             # Include Example42's module with default access
include *                    # Include whatever Example42 module to automatically manage its firewalling
